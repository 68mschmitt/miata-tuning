# Miata Tuning – Turbocharged 1995 Mazda Miata (BP4W Swap)

Welcome to my Miata tuning project!
This repository contains the project files, notes, and Megasquirt 2 Extra (MS2Extra) ECU tune configurations for my custom-built 1995 Mazda Miata.

This isn’t just a stock NA Miata—it’s a forged-internals, turbocharged, track-ready machine designed for both power and reliability.
